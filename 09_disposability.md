Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown – The twelve-factor app’s processes are disposable, meaning they can be started or stopped at a moment’s notice. Graceful shutdowns are very important and the system must ensure the correct state. 

In the world of containerization and microservices, the deployment process implicitly follows this principle to a greater extent.
