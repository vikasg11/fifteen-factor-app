### X.	Dev/Prod Parity

Keep Development, Staging, and Production as Similar as Possible

The twelve-factor app is designed for continuous deployment by keeping the gap between development and production small. The twelve-factor also resist using different backing services between development and production, even when adapters theoretically abstract away any differences in backing services. Backing services, such as the appâ€™s database, queueing system, or cache, is one area where dev/prod parity is important. 

Additionally, having the right processes like Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) in place facilitates bridging this gap further.
