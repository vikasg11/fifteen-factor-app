### XV.	Authentication and Authorization

Security is a very important aspect of any application. At times, while capturing the business requirements, people tend to ignore the security aspect but once realized, it has to be done the right way. All the applications, especially Cloud-Native applications, secure their APIs using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). 

Simplest of the reason for using user security is to maintain the audit trail of the events happened for a user session, or which user has made what data changes.

There are numerous solutions available like OAuth2, OpenID Connect, various SSO servers, and standards that can simplify the Authentication and Authorization implementation for an application.
